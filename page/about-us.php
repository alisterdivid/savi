                        <p>Events can take place in a variety of spaces such as basements, roofs, patios, backyards,
                            upper floors of a building and even on islands.Handling covers the time needed to overcome
                            anything out of the ordinary to get the equipment to your site.It includes such things as
                            stairs, elevators, long distances from the parking area to the site, steep hills to a
                            backyard or park, taking a ferry to an island and also the waiting time for somebody to open
                            a venue.It is always best to work out the fine details prior to delivery to avoid additional
                            charges at the time of delivery.</p>

                        <p>If you require assistance to set up before an event and strike (or take down) a party tent
                            and other equipment after an event, we can certainly look after this task for you. You will
                            need to arrange this service in advance so we can allocate the time for our crews to get the
                            job done right.We will also require a plan as to where the equipment needs to go in order to
                            avoid delays.While certain equipment includes setup and strike, such as tents, portable
                            bars, and umbrella tables, there are certain items we will not set up and strike such as
                            linens, dishes, and glasses.You can arrange to have our crew set up hardware like tables and
                            chairs as required but it is preferred that you look after sanitized and clean equipment so
                            it can be setup as close to the event as possible and handled with clean and delicate
                            hands. </p>

                        <p>It is easy to calculate the correct size of a tent for a certain number of people but it is
                            not so easy to fit a 20&#215;20 tent in an area that is 19&#215;19 with a swing set, three
                            different levels of patio and with an overhanging tree that is 200 feet from where the
                            delivery truck can park. Our tent rentals technician can visit your site anywhere in the
                            Greater Toronto Area (and even in Niagara Falls and Collingwood), and note anything out of
                            the ordinary that might affect the setup and/or cost of the tent. There is nothing quite
                            like seeing things first hand and planned ahead in order to avoid any added stress hours
                            before your event! </p>
